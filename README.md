# Self Service Infra and Github Operations (using Atlantis) Example


## Objective

The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of a robust CI/CD platform (Codefresh) integrated with a leading cloud provider (AWS) using Infrastructure as Code (IAC). This initiative aims to empower teams within the company or startup by providing a streamlined and self-service approach to onboarding and service rollout. Through this solution, we aspire to enhance the developer experience within a secure and well-governed framework, ultimately fostering efficiency and agility in our development processes.
